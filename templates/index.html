<!-- Creating a Homepage
    Usually the homepage is called as index.html -->

{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}
        <div class="container">
        {% for post in post_list %}    <!-- Created a FOR LOOP -->
            <div class="card m-3">    <!-- This puts each blog inside of a box with 3px margin gap -->
                <div class="card-body">    <!-- Making a body for each blog -->
                    <h2 class="card-title">    <!-- Giving title to each of the blogs -->
                        {{post.title}}
                    </h2>
                    <p class="card-text">   <!-- Giving content to each of the blogs -->
                        {{post.content | slice:"600"}}    <!-- With SLICE filter, it will only show the first 500 characters from the contnent text -->
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Author: {{post.author | title}}    <!-- Adding the author's name inside the card. With TITLE filter, it will make first letters of each word capital -->
                    </p>
                    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="{% url 'blog_view' post.slug %}">Read More</a>
                    <!-- To make the title a clickable link, <h2> tag should be replaced by <a> tag.
                        And these <a> tags should come as a value of href property
                        Inside of the "", "localhost:8000/{{post.slug}}" can be written.
                        However, this is not ideal, because local host will be changed to sth else when the app is deployed.
                        Best way will be using a url tag like above (url '' post.slug). This makes url the keyword.
                        Inside of the '' goes the url of that current post that is being iterated in the loop, which we can get from urls.py
                        
                        To turn the clickable link to a clickable BUTTON: class="btn btn-primary" -->
                </div>
            </div>
        {% endfor %}    <!-- Ended the FOR LOOP -->
        </div>
{% endblock content %}

<!-- post_list is a view which it needs to be defined in views.py
    and the class name has to be in the same format with the one inside the for loop -->
