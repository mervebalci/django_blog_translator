<!-- When the user clicks on the Submit button, the url ('get_translation') will be visited.
    And the method is POST method, which means that user is sending some data and
    they expect to get back some data processed from the server -->


<!-- type="submit" means when that submit button is pressed, <form> will be sent.
    So will send the data (the original text of the user) in this case.
    And value is the name of the button -->


<!-- Let's define the url where this page will be served. There are 2 things to do:
    First, go to mysite>urls.py and add the new url pattern for this translator app.
    Then go to translator folder and create urls.py file.
    And now here, define the the urls because one app could contain multiple pages.-->
