# A view is basically could be either Python function or a Python class,
# which is an organizer or a middleman between the model of that particular webpage and the HTML code or also referred to as a template.
# So a view is the middleman that makes the communication between the MODEL and the HTML TEMPLATE.
# Because the model is just a database table and to bring/serve those data to a browser, HTML code is needed.

# View gets data form Model and gives those data to the HTML template.
